# RuneScape Agent Roadmap And Task List

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking. Update this file whenever you start, finish, block, or defer a task.

**Goal:** Track the remaining design and build work needed for `res:agent` to become a safe, modular, self-improving RuneScape resident that can explore, chat, fight, trade, and perform starter workflows.

**Architecture:** SOUL files define resident identity and module selection. The SPARK kernel owns safety, runtime scheduling, action submission, evidence, logs, budgets, and persistence. Reviewed SPARK modules provide RuneScape thinking, workflows, knowledge, benchmarks, and experiments through explicit capability seams.

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript, Zod, Jest, SWC, existing RuneJS server/controller/dashboard, SPARK module registry, dashboard repo, JSONL action/inference logs, Markdown knowledge docs.

## Status Legend

- `[x]` Done and verified.
- `[>]` In progress in the current branch/session.
- `[!]` Blocked and needs a named decision or dependency.
- `[ ]` Not started.
- `[~]` Designed, but not yet implemented.

Agents should update the status marker and add a one-line note under the task when meaningful progress happens.

## Current Baseline

- `[x]` SPARK module seam exists.
  - SOUL can select reviewed in-repo modules.
  - `onion.runescape.standard` wraps the current hybrid agent.
  - Module id/version are logged with inference and action metadata.
  - Strict SOUL module parsing rejects unknown executable fields and duplicate module ids.
  - Focused and full test suites passed after implementation.
- `[x]` Starter agent can make a fire in local testing.
- `[x]` Action evidence is less fragile than before.
  - Movement waits honor `move_to.range`.
  - Item/action effect waits ignore unrelated position churn.
  - Gateway request ids and module metadata are preserved on attempts.
- `[x]` Gateway local safety improved.
  - Tokenless access is loopback-only.
  - Example gateway config uses `127.0.0.1` and a placeholder auth token.
- `[x]` MVP game-skill context, workflow availability, prompt injection, and knowledge suggestion plumbing exist.
- `[x]` A dedicated agent-facing RuneScape skill/doc index exists under `docs/runescape-skill/`.
- `[ ]` Benchmark harness and dashboard module panels are not built yet.

## Workstream A: SPARK Capability Facades

**Purpose:** Let OnionDAO members experiment with modules without giving arbitrary code raw filesystem, network, secrets, mutable state, or controller internals.

- `[ ]` **A1: Design the safe module context API.**
  - Files: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-20-spark-module-system-design.md`, `src/controller/spark/modules.ts`
  - Deliverable: a documented interface for read-only state, resident-scoped memory, budgeted inference, action proposals, and telemetry.
  - Verification: design review by architecture and security subagents.

- `[ ]` **A2: Implement read-only state and perception facades.**
  - Files: `src/controller/spark/module-context.ts`, `src/controller/spark/module-context.test.ts`
  - Deliverable: modules can inspect resident state/perception without mutating `RuntimeState`.
  - Verification: Jest tests prove mutation attempts do not affect runtime state.

- `[ ]` **A3: Implement resident-scoped memory facade.**
  - Files: `src/controller/spark/module-memory.ts`, `src/controller/spark/module-memory.test.ts`
  - Deliverable: modules can read/write only approved resident-local paths and cannot invoke arbitrary `qmd` or process execution.
  - Verification: tests reject absolute paths, parent traversal, and unknown namespaces.

- `[ ]` **A4: Implement budgeted inference facade.**
  - Files: `src/controller/spark/module-inference.ts`, `src/controller/spark/module-inference.test.ts`
  - Deliverable: modules call inference through explicit profiles and budgets, not raw `LlmClient`.
  - Verification: tests cover budget exhaustion, profile selection, and redacted logging.

- `[ ]` **A5: Enforce module capabilities before invoking facets.**
  - Files: `src/controller/spark/modules.ts`, `src/controller/thinking/thinking-module.ts`
  - Deliverable: a module cannot expose `thinking`, `hooks`, `nervous-rules`, `candidates`, `prompt-sections`, or `attempt-observer` behavior unless its manifest declares that capability.
  - Verification: module registry tests reject capability/implementation mismatches.

## Workstream B: Standard RuneScape Module Extraction

**Purpose:** Turn the current large hybrid agent into composable, inspectable modules that can be swapped, benchmarked, and improved independently.

- `[x]` **B1: Keep `onion.runescape.standard` as the compatibility adapter.**
  - Files: `src/controller/spark/standard-modules.ts`, `src/controller/soul/starter-souls/res-agent.md`
  - Verified as the first SPARK slice; future work should preserve this as the default stable module.

- `[ ]` **B2: Extract starter workflow cards.**
  - Files: `src/controller/spark/runescape-workflows.ts`, `src/controller/spark/runescape-workflows.test.ts`, `src/controller/thinking/hybrid-agent-thinking-module.ts`
  - Deliverable: woodcutting, firemaking, fishing, prayer, safe combat, follow/chat, and exploration workflow definitions live outside the hybrid module.
  - Verification: existing hybrid tests still pass; new workflow tests verify prerequisites and next actions.

- `[ ]` **B3: Extract deterministic Body routines.**
  - Files: `src/controller/spark/runescape-body-routines.ts`, `src/controller/spark/runescape-body-routines.test.ts`
  - Deliverable: "make fire", "walk to interaction range", "use tool on target", "eat food", and "recover from stuck" routines are separate from inference prompts.
  - Verification: tests simulate perception and assert typed `AgentAction` sequences.

- `[ ]` **B4: Extract Brain goal planner.**
  - Files: `src/controller/spark/runescape-brain-planner.ts`, `src/controller/spark/runescape-brain-planner.test.ts`
  - Deliverable: high-level goals are selected from skill progress, inventory, nearby affordances, SOUL preferences, and benchmark task hints.
  - Verification: tests cover goal choice for firemaking, fishing, combat survival, follow/chat, and exploration.

- `[ ]` **B5: Extract Nervous survival rules into a module facet.**
  - Files: `src/controller/spark/runescape-nervous-rules.ts`, `src/controller/spark/runescape-nervous-rules.test.ts`, `src/controller/nervous-system/*`
  - Deliverable: survival behavior remains kernel-priority but can be supplied by first-party modules.
  - Verification: low HP, enemy attack, blocked/stuck, and dangerous area tests.

## Workstream C: Benchmark Harness

**Purpose:** Prove whether modules actually help the resident play RuneScape instead of relying on vibes.

- `[ ]` **C1: Define benchmark artifact schema.**
  - Files: `src/controller/benchmarks/benchmark-artifact.ts`, `src/controller/benchmarks/benchmark-artifact.test.ts`
  - Deliverable: JSON artifact includes run id, module id/version, task id/version, resident, model profile, commits, start/end times, pass/fail, score, metrics, and failure reason.
  - Verification: schema tests reject missing module identity and invalid statuses.

- `[ ]` **C2: Add disposable benchmark resident runner.**
  - Files: `src/controller/benchmarks/benchmark-runner.ts`, `src/controller/benchmarks/benchmark-runner.test.ts`
  - Deliverable: create/connect a disposable resident, run a bounded task, collect action/inference/perception evidence, then cleanly stop.
  - Verification: mocked gateway test proves lifecycle and cleanup.

- `[ ]` **C3: Implement `make-fire-5m` verifier.**
  - Files: `src/controller/benchmarks/tasks/make-fire-5m.ts`, `src/controller/benchmarks/tasks/make-fire-5m.test.ts`
  - Deliverable: pass when logs are consumed and a fire appears or firemaking success event is observed within the time budget.
  - Verification: fixture tests for pass, timeout, wrong action, and unsafe loop.

- `[ ]` **C4: Implement starter benchmark suite.**
  - Tasks: `woodcutting-firemaking-10m`, `starter-fishing-5m`, `combat-prayer-10m`, `explore-report-5m`, `follow-and-chat-5m`
  - Deliverable: every task has a verifier, scoring rubric, and fixture tests.
  - Verification: benchmark task tests pass locally and artifacts are written to the configured output dir.

- `[ ]` **C5: Add benchmark CLI.**
  - Files: `src/controller/benchmarks/cli.ts`, `package.json`
  - Deliverable: `npm run controller:bench -- --task make-fire-5m --module onion.runescape.standard`
  - Verification: dry-run test and one local smoke run when server/controller are available.

## Workstream D: Dashboard Debugging

**Purpose:** Let humans see whether the agent is alive, what it wants, what module is driving it, and why it failed.

- `[ ]` **D1: Expose module stack in dashboard data.**
  - Files: dashboard API/client files, controller log readers
  - Deliverable: resident observer view shows selected module id/version/config and active facets.
  - Verification: dashboard test or local browser screenshot at `/observe/resident/res%3Aagent`.

- `[ ]` **D2: Add current goal and last thought/action panel.**
  - Files: dashboard resident observe route/components
  - Deliverable: humans can see active goal, recent action, evidence, final status, and failure reason.
  - Verification: Playwright/browser inspection with `res:agent`.

- `[ ]` **D3: Add benchmark run list and detail pages.**
  - Files: dashboard benchmark routes/components
  - Deliverable: list benchmark artifacts, filter by module/task, and inspect run timeline.
  - Verification: fixture artifacts render correctly.

- `[ ]` **D4: Add module leaderboard.**
  - Files: dashboard benchmark components
  - Deliverable: compare modules by pass rate, progress, efficiency, safety, reliability, and cost.
  - Verification: fixture data ranks modules deterministically.

## Workstream E: RuneScape Knowledge And Agent Skill

**Purpose:** Give resident modules a maintained "how to play RuneScape" knowledge base and a safe way to suggest improvements.

- `[x]` **E1: Create RuneScape game-skill index.**
  - Files: `docs/runescape-skill/README.md`, `docs/runescape-skill/starter-workflows.md`, `docs/runescape-skill/items.md`, `docs/runescape-skill/places.md`
  - Deliverable: agent-readable docs for tools, skill requirements, starter locations, common actions, and recovery tactics.
  - Verification: knowledge retriever tests can find entries for logs, tinderbox, shrimp, bones, Lumbridge, and basic combat.
  - Verified 2026-05-20 on `codex/body-waiter-coordinator` with `npm test -- --runInBand src/controller/knowledge/game-skill-entries.test.ts`.

- `[x]` **E2: Wire knowledge retrieval into standard module prompts.**
  - Files: `src/controller/knowledge/game-skill-context.ts`, `src/controller/thinking/hybrid-agent-prompts.ts`
  - Deliverable: Brain and Body prompts receive concise relevant knowledge snippets based on current goal and perception.
  - Verification: prompt tests assert firemaking/fishing/combat snippets appear when relevant and stay absent when irrelevant.
  - Verified in `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-20-runescape-game-skill-implementation.md`.

- `[x]` **E3: Add agent knowledge suggestion workflow.**
  - Files: `src/controller/knowledge/suggestions.ts`, `docs/controller-knowledge-runbook.md`
  - Deliverable: agents can suggest knowledge updates to a review queue; Codex/humans approve before docs change.
  - Verification: tests cover dedupe, storage mode, and review command output.
  - Verified in `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-20-runescape-game-skill-implementation.md`.

- `[~]` **E4: Add wiki import/update instructions for Railgun and local dev.**
  - Files: `docs/controller-knowledge-runbook.md`, `docs/runescape-skill/README.md`
  - Deliverable: OnionDAO can update knowledge snapshots reproducibly.
  - Verification: command examples are copy/pasteable and use configured data dirs.
  - Note: controller knowledge runbook exists; dedicated RuneScape skill/wiki update docs still need to be completed.

## Workstream F: Human-Like Behavior Layer

**Purpose:** Make the resident feel like a human-ish player instead of a static script.

- `[ ]` **F1: Goal sharing cadence.**
  - Files: `src/controller/thinking/hybrid-agent-thinking-module.ts`, extracted Brain planner when available
  - Deliverable: agent periodically says what he is trying to do, why, and what he needs from nearby humans.
  - Verification: chat tests cover "I am going to chop logs", "I need a tinderbox/logs", and "I am stuck near a fence".

- `[ ]` **F2: Nearby human reaction.**
  - Files: standard module Body/Brain code and tests
  - Deliverable: agent hears public chat, responds to direct commands, asks clarifying questions, and follows simple requests.
  - Verification: perception/chat tests for command prefix, direct name mention, and non-command small talk.

- `[ ]` **F3: Stuck recovery.**
  - Files: Body routine extraction files
  - Deliverable: after repeated failed movement or unreachable target attempts, agent tries alternate target, steps back, returns to anchor, or asks for help.
  - Verification: tests simulate blocked tree/fence and assert recovery, not tiny-step loops.

- `[ ]` **F4: Exploration loop.**
  - Files: Brain planner, Body routines, knowledge docs
  - Deliverable: agent walks to visible landmarks, reports what he sees, records useful places, and returns to anchor periodically.
  - Verification: local live test or simulation where dashboard shows meaningful movement and chat.

- `[ ]` **F5: Combat survival personality.**
  - Files: nervous rules, combat workflow, standard module
  - Deliverable: agent eats when hurt, attacks weak aggressors when reasonable, runs when outmatched, and explains danger.
  - Verification: combat fixture tests and one live local smoke if available.

## Workstream G: Real Gameplay Workflows

**Purpose:** Expand from "can make a fire" to basic RuneScape loops.

- `[ ]` **G1: Woodcutting plus firemaking loop.**
  - Deliverable: find level-appropriate tree, chop logs, make fire, repeat safely.
  - Success metric: produces at least one fire from self-chopped logs in benchmark or live test.

- `[ ]` **G2: Fishing plus cooking loop.**
  - Deliverable: find fishing spot, use small net, catch shrimp, cook on range/fire when available.
  - Success metric: inventory changes from raw shrimp to cooked shrimp or clear failure explanation.

- `[ ]` **G3: Prayer starter loop.**
  - Deliverable: bury bones from inventory or safe defeated enemies.
  - Success metric: prayer XP/level evidence or action success event.

- `[ ]` **G4: Trading/giving items.**
  - Deliverable: request trade, offer simple item, accept/decline safely, describe trade state.
  - Success metric: test covers trade request, offer, accept, and decline.

- `[ ]` **G5: Follow and command loop.**
  - Deliverable: agent follows configured player, responds to "agent come here", "agent make fire", "agent stop", "agent status".
  - Success metric: local browser test with human client can see movement or chat within 10 seconds.

## Workstream H: Railgun And OnionDAO Operations

**Purpose:** Make this usable by the team, not just on one laptop.

- `[ ]` **H1: Write SPARK module author guide.**
  - Files: `docs/spark-module-authoring.md`
  - Deliverable: how to create a reviewed in-repo module, choose manifest fields, write tests, run benchmarks, and open a PR.
  - Verification: guide links to real files and commands.

- `[ ]` **H2: Write Railgun deployment guide.**
  - Files: `docs/railgun-controller-deployment.md`
  - Deliverable: required env vars, gateway auth, log/artifact dirs, dashboard URL, controller start commands, safety rules.
  - Verification: security review confirms no tokenless public/private-network control.

- `[ ]` **H3: Add module experiment workflow.**
  - Files: `docs/spark-module-experiments.md`
  - Deliverable: how OnionDAO members compare modules with benchmarks and dashboard artifacts.
  - Verification: dry run with fixture artifacts.

- `[ ]` **H4: Define update process for this roadmap.**
  - Files: this file
  - Deliverable: every PR that changes agent behavior updates task status and links benchmark/test evidence.
  - Verification: PR checklist includes roadmap update.

## Immediate Recommended Next Slice

- `[ ]` Build Workstream C1-C3 and D1 together.
  - Why: benchmarks plus dashboard module visibility create the shortest feedback loop.
  - Expected outcome: a human can watch `res:agent`, see `onion.runescape.standard`, run `make-fire-5m`, and inspect a pass/fail artifact.

## Agent Update Protocol

When an agent works on this roadmap:

1. Change one task from `[ ]` or `[~]` to `[>]` before editing code.
2. Add a short note below the task with date, branch/session, and intended verification.
3. When done, change it to `[x]` only after tests/build or a live experiment passes.
4. If blocked, change it to `[!]` and write the exact blocker plus the next decision needed.
5. Keep task edits narrow; do not rewrite unrelated roadmap sections.

## Verification Commands

Use these before marking roadmap implementation tasks done:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build
npm test -- --runInBand
```

For dashboard/browser work, also run a local browser smoke test against the relevant dashboard route and capture the observed result in the task note.
